## 🚀 Why This Repo?

I took a 1-year break from coding, and now I'm rebuilding my muscle memory step-by-step — using **Vanilla JavaScript** without any frameworks.

This repo helps me:
- Stay consistent through small daily tasks  
- Build confidence with logic  
- Keep track of my comeback journey

## 💻 How to Run

1. Open any `.html` file in a browser  
2. Check output in the **browser console (F12 > Console tab)**  
3. Modify the script in `<script>` tag to try new logic
